    "To analyse the impact of the opposition’s proposal, it is first necessary to make some assumptions regarding the definition of professional landlords. Two main parameters were therefore considered: the number of properties owned by a host and the number of days a property was available for short-term rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, all landlords with two or more properties were counted. The analysis shows that almost 29% of all hosts in London list more than one property on the Airbnb platform. This finding contrasts with one of the arguments used to justify Airbnb’s lower tax burden—namely, that short-term rentals provide a means for local residents to generate extra income by renting out their homes when they are travelling. However, just under one third of Airbnb hosts in London are listing properties that are unlikely to be their primary residence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the first parameter, a second criterion was established. If a property was available on Airbnb for 180 days or more in a given year, it was considered highly likely to be managed by a professional host. The analysis found that nearly 37% of all hosts in London have properties available for 180 days or more annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "A professional host was therefore defined as one who meets both of these criteria. Consequently, the properties affected by the opposition’s proposal are those associated with professional landlords. The results indicate that slightly more than 15% of all Airbnb hosts in London fall into this category. Under this scenario, the analysis reveals that the opposition’s proposal would affect 25,512 properties, representing 26.40% of all properties listed on Airbnb in London."
